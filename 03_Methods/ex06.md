The error messages tells me that on line 1 in irb, a method was defined that takes 2 parameters. Then later, on line 4 of irb the method was called with only 1 argument passed to the method.

This also tells me that while the first method parameter may have had a default value set, the second parameter definitely did not. If the second parameter had a default value set in the method definition, then the single argument passed to the method would have been used for the first parameter, and the second parameter would have used a default value. Therefore, this particular error would not have been thrown.
