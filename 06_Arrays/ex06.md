The problem here is the [] is actually an instance method of the Array class that accepts an integer as an argument, where the argument is the index of the array. names[0] is the same as calling the method [] on names (i.e. names.[](0)), where 0 is the index argument. By using 'margaret' in brackets, the wrong data type is passed to the [] method.

The problem can be fixed by passing the index associated with the value 'margaret': 
names[3] = 'jody'

Or, if the index is not known at runtime, the problem can be resolved by using the Array instance method #index and the value 'margaret': 

names[names.index('margaret')] = 'jody'
