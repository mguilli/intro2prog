This error is thrown because - while the "def" and "end" keywords are occupying the same indentation level, the "end" keyword is actually closing the if/else statement. This leaves the method definition without and "end" keyword, throwing an error. 

To correct this, an "end" keyword must be placed after the first "end", but BEFORE the equal_to_for(5) method call. Placing the "end" keyword after the method call will create and a recursion method with no exit, leading to stack overflow if the method is called elsewhere in the program.
